# Health Monitoring System using Arduino

This project monitors body temperature and heart rate using LM35 and a Pulse Sensor. The data is displayed on a 16x2 LCD.

## Overview

- Measures temperature using LM35 sensor.
- Detects heartbeats and calculates BPM using a Pulse Sensor.
- Displays both readings on a 16x2 LCD.
- Includes alert system using an LED when values exceed thresholds.

## Components

- Arduino UNO
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- Pulse Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- LED (for alert)
- Resistors (1kΩ, 2kΩ)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
